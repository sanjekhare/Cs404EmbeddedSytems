# Comment from Mark A. Yoder
# Got it.  Thanks...
# I get errors when I compile your code:
In file included from mmap2.c:10:0:
beaglebone_gpio.h:1:0: error: unterminated #ifndef
mmap2.c: In function 'main':
mmap2.c:70:20: error: 'GPIO_40' undeclared 

Looks like the code is close to working, but not all the way there.

I was working in windows and for some reason git on windows is not working. I am pushing this from ubuntu now. Thank you for notifing me of this error.
