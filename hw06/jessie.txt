Device Overlay

1. export files to bash variables like slots etc.
2. ./findGPIO.js to find the offset address of P9_42, it was 0x164.
3. copied DM-gpio-Test.dts.
4. edited it so the that pin9_42 is pulled up input pin. 
5. compiled with dtc to make dtb0 file
6. moved it to lib/firmware
7. activated it using  echo SK-gpio-set > $SLOTS.
8. Checked it using findGPIO
9. Removed it using -7> $SLOTS.


|-------------------------------------------|
Current stable version is Debian 8, Jessie
Current testing version is Strech
Current unstable version is Sid.



|-------------------------------------------|
Currently 36650 packages are installed.
I used apt-cache (as shown in the class) instead of apt-get pkgnames (as written on the HW sheet).

Due connectivity error htop could not be installed.
Ran apt-get update
Tried sudo apt-get --fix-missing install htop
Again it got stuck at connecting to debian server.
It gave an error 
E: Internal Error, ordering was unable to handle the media swap


Note: Screenshots of various step are in the folder.
