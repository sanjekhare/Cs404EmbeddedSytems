Current stable version is Debian 8, Jessie
Current testing version is Strech
Current unstable version is Sid

Currently 36650 packages are installed.
I used apt-cache (as shown in the class) instead of apt-get pkgnames (as written on the HW sheet).

Due connectivity error htop could not be installed.
Ran apt-get update
Tried sudo apt-get --fix-missing install htop
Again it got stuck at connecting to debian server.
It gave an error 
E: Internal Error, ordering was unable to handle the media swap


Note: Screenshots of various step are in the folder.
